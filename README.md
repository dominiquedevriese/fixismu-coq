Coq proofs for the results reported in [_On the Semantic Expresiveness of
Recursive Types_][arxiv]. They establish semantic equi-expressiveness results
between simply-typed lambda calculi with
1. a fixpoint combinator
2. iso-recurisve types
3. equi-recursive types

The proof uses a technique called approximate backtranslation, which is
discussed in detail in [the paper][arxiv] and its references.

This artifact was developed by [Dominique Devriese] and [Eric Mark Martin]. It leverages machinery developed by [Steven Keuchel].

### Assumptions

We depend on only two Axioms
* [`Coq.Logic.FunctionalExtensionality.functional_extensionality_dep`][functional_extensionality_dep]
* [`Coq.Logic.Eqdep.Eq_rect_eq.eq_rect_eq`][eq_rect_eq]

## Differences to the Paper

1. Each of the languages has a second specification of their terms, contexts,
   and typing rules (for both terms and contexts) in SpecAnnot.v. These
   specifications fully annotate the types in all terms (e.g. terms of type `τ x
   σ` are annotated with `τ` and `σ`). These specifications come with
   `eraseAnnot` functions to convert back into the normal specification by
   erasing these annotations, along with proofs that these conversions are
   type-sound.
   
   This is only an implementation detail—the top-level full abstraction
   results are stated with respect to the "normal" specification.

2. This artifact, unlike the paper, cannot elide the contractiveness of
   recursive types for consision. You will see `ValidTy τ` throughout the
   artifact, which says that `τ` is both contractive and closed.
